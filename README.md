# Retroflag-Gpi-backrounds-theme-images
A full replacement set of images for the gbz35 dark theme. Changes to greenscreen effect images of all the most popular machines (52 i think at last count) with release dates shown in the corner for each machine. Sized specifically for the gpi and similar sized screens.

Designed to just be dropped in on top of the gbz35 dark theme. Video of the theme in use on an ExPi Piboy DMG is here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w60lnTyW_lw&t=54s
